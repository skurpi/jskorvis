The korvfest order

This is actually just a javascript experiment to write a (weekly) rotating schedule of names.

It has a few criterias:

- The list can increase and decrease.
- A name can be added to the list at any location.
- The order must be maintained at all times

The solution is a bit crude, where it is based on the current week and a person to start from.

But it works, so why not.
